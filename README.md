# TR_Park

**TR_Park** is a computer vision project developed for the SIH Hackathon. The project focuses on vehicle detection and traffic analysis using deep learning models and real-world traffic images and videos. It leverages state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (YOLOv3 and YOLOv8) to identify and count vehicles in various scenes, aiming to support smart city and traffic management solutions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (for YOLOv8)
- Other dependencies as required (see below)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dasoam/TR_Park.git
   cd TR_Park
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy torch
   ```
   *You may need to install additional packages depending on your environment and model requirements.*

3. **Download YOLO weights (if not present):**
   - `yolov3.weights` and `yolov8m.pt` should be present in the repo. If not, download from the official sources.

---

## Usage

### For YOLOv3 (Image Detection)

```bash
python Car_detection.py --image traffic.jpg
```
- This will process `traffic.jpg` and output the detection results (e.g., `out.jpg`).

### For YOLOv8 (Image Detection)

```bash
python vechile_detection_v8.py --image traffic2.jpg
```
- Replace the image filename as needed.

### For Video Detection

- Modify the script to use `traffic_viedo3.mp4` as input, or adapt for webcam/stream input.

---

## Model Details

- **YOLOv3:** Uses `yolov3.cfg` and `yolov3.weights` for object detection. Classes are defined in `coco.names`.
- **YOLOv8:** Uses `yolov8m.pt` for improved detection accuracy and speed.

---

## Sample Results

Sample input and output images are included in the repository:
- `1_car.jpg`, `multi_car.jpg`, `traffic.jpg`, etc.
- Output images: `out.jpg`, `result.jpg`, `result.jpeg`
